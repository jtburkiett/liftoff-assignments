Bootiful Testing, Wednesday, December 13, 2017, 6:30 PM, Test Driven Development

Introduction to testing and test driven development within Spring testing libraries. 

To be honest, I didn't learn a lot from this meetup. I feel a lot of the subject matter was a little over my head in terms of what
I've learned through LaunchCode and on my own. I did learn that the coding community is very open, friendly and eager to help one
another learn. 

As far as resources for continued education on this topic and Spring in general. I find that Spring Developments channel on Youtube
seems like a great resource. Seems like they update it weekly and are active on the comment threads for any questions one might have
on content.
